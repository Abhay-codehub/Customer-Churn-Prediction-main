# `Problem Statement: Customer Churn Prediction`

In today's competitive business landscape, customer retention is paramount for sustainable growth and success. Our challenge is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are at risk of churning â€“ discontinuing their use of our service. Customer churn can lead to a significant loss of revenue and a decline in market share. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to build a model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their historical usage behavior, demographic information, and subscription details. This predictive model will allow us to proactively target high-risk customers with personalized retention strategies, ultimately helping us enhance customer satisfaction, reduce churn rates, and optimize our business strategies. The goal is to create an effective solution that contributes to the long-term success of our company by fostering customer loyalty and engagement.

# `Data Description`
Dataset consists customer information for a customer churn prediction problem. It includes the following columns:

* **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.


* **Name**: Name of the customer.


* **Age: Age of the customer.**


* **Gender**: Gender of the customer (Male or Female).


* **Location**: Location where the customer is based, with options including Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, and New York.


* **Subscription_Length_Months**: The number of months the customer has been subscribed.


* **Monthly_Bill**: Monthly bill amount for the customer.


* **Total_Usage_GB**: Total usage in gigabytes.


* **Churn**: A binary indicator (1 or 0) representing whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

# `Teck Tech Used`
* **Python Programming Language**

Python serves as the primary programming language for data analysis, modeling, and implementation of machine learning algorithms due to its rich ecosystem of libraries and packages.

* **Pandas**

Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions for effectively working with structured data, such as CSV files or databases.

* **NumPy**

NumPy is a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

* **Matplotlib and Seaborn**

Matplotlib is used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

* **Jupyter Notebook**

Jupyter Notebook is an interactive web-based tool that allows for creating and sharing documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is commonly used for data analysis and exploration.

* **Scikit-Learn (sklearn)**

Scikit-Learn is a machine learning library in Python that provides a wide range of tools for various machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, model selection, and more.

* **Random Forest Classifier**

Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust and accurate model. It's used for both classification and regression tasks.


* **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**

The VIF is used to detect multicollinearity among predictor variables in a regression analysis. It helps identify redundant variables that might negatively impact model performance.


* **Model Evaluation Metrics**

Various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC (Area Under Curve) are used to assess the performance of the machine learning models.


* **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost**

These are different classification algorithms used to build predictive models based on the given data. Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses.


* **TensorFlow and Keras**

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. Keras is a high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow. They are used for building and training deep learning models.


* **Neural Networks**

Neural networks are used to model complex relationships in the data. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes that simulate the behavior of neurons in the human brain. Deep learning algorithms are based on neural networks.


* **StandardScaler**

StandardScaler is used for standardizing features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. It's an important preprocessing step in machine learning to ensure features are on similar scales.


* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the data into a new coordinate system while preserving as much variance as possible. It's useful for reducing the complexity of high-dimensional data.


* **GridSearchCV**

GridSearchCV is used for hyperparameter tuning, where a set of hyperparameters are tested exhaustively to find the combination that produces the best performance for the model.


* **Cross-Validation**

Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the generalization performance of a model by splitting the dataset into multiple subsets (folds) for training and testing.


* **Early Stopping**

Early stopping is a regularization technique used in training neural networks. It stops training when the model's performance on a validation set starts deteriorating, preventing overfitting.

* **ModelCheckpoint**

ModelCheckpoint is a callback in Keras that saves the model's weights during training. It helps to save the best model based on a specific metric, allowing you to restore the model later.


* **ROC Curve and AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)**

ROC curve is a graphical representation of the trade-off between the true positive rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (1-specificity). AUC measures the area under the ROC curve and is used as a metric to evaluate binary classification models.


* **Standard Machine Learning Libraries**

The project utilizes standard machine learning libraries like SciPy and scikit-learn for various tasks including preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.


# `Outcome`
The outcome of this customer churn prediction project involves developing a machine learning model to predict whether customers are likely to churn or not. This prediction is based on various customer attributes such as age, gender, location, subscription length, monthly bill, and total usage. The model's primary purpose is to assist in identifying customers who are at a higher risk of churning, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain them. By using the trained model to predict churn, the company can allocate resources more effectively, personalize engagement strategies, and implement targeted retention efforts. Ultimately, the project's success is measured by the model's ability to make predictions, helping the company reduce churn rates, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize its customer retention strategies.
